# Number-to-Letter Grade Converter

## Description

This is a simple tool for converting number grades to letter grades. The user can input any amount of whole-number number grades, and the program will return the letter grade equivalents. The program does this by storing the number grade input into an array list, and then converting and printing out each element of the array list one at a time. 

This project was originally created for an assignment in my CS232 class, focusing on the declaration and usage of array lists.

Note: Number grades above 100 and below 0 are accepted, but will be converted to As and Fs, respectively.

## Installation

Please download the Gradeconvert.jar file and run it using an appropriate Java Runtime Environment. Source code for the program can be viewed via the Gradeconvert.java file.

## How to Use

1. Open executing, the user will be prompted to input a list of number grades.
```
Please list the grades you wish to convert: 
```
2. The user is allowed to input any amount of *integer* number grades. 
```
Please list the grades you wish to convert: 
90
82
65
```
3. Once the user has finished listing the number grades, he or she can convert them by inserting any *non-integer* value.
```
Please list the grades you wish to convert: 
90
82
65
A
```
4. The number grades will then be printed out to the screen, along with their letter grade equivalents.
```
Please list the grades you wish to convert: 
90
82
65
A

90 is an A
82 is a B
65 is a D
```
